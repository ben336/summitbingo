                This is a light-hearted game of Bingo for anyone who spends their weekends at the Summit Church in the Research Triangle of North Carolina. Try and see if you can achieve a bingo by watching for the following phrases and occurrences during the course of this week's sermon.

                Please note that this does not count as "taking notes". It also will probably add very little spiritual enrichment. It may however allow us to laugh together. Play responsibly.
