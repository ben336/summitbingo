# Summit Bingo

This is a light-hearted game of Bingo for anyone who spends their weekends at the Summit Church in the Research Triangle of North Carolina. Try and see if you can achieve a bingo by watching for the following phrases and occurrences during the course of this week's sermon.

Please note that this does not count as "taking notes". It also will probably add very little spiritual enrichment. It may however allow us to laugh together. Play responsibly.

If you have suggestions for improvements to this game, or more content for the bingo boards, feel free to let me know via twitter at [@ben336](https://twitter.com/ben336) or open a pull request here. Please keep suggestions clean, funny, and appropriate. When in doubt, aim to fear God, respect the church, and love people.

## For Developers

If you want to add something to the bingo game, feel free to fork the project and make a pull request, or open an issue.  The code is written in coffeescript and stylus for the js and css respectively.

There's a grunt task to automate building the project, but you can also manually build the projects using the respective compilers for stylus and coffeescript.  Feel free to get in touch with me if you have any issues.
